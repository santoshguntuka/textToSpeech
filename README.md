Step 1: Get Set Up
You’ll need:

A code editor (like Visual Studio Code).
Python installed on your computer.
An account with ElevenLabs to use their Text-to-Speech API.
Step 2: Sign Up for ElevenLabs
Create an account and get your API key for authenticating TTS requests.

One cool thing about ElevenLabs, is that it can even be trained on your voice, or you can choose from a large library of voice options. This TTS API also has really great emotional range and contextual awareness as well.

Step 3: Choose an Article Source
look for sites that offer RSS feeds of their content. Good options include major news sites, technology blogs, or interest-specific sites. RSS feeds provide article titles, summaries, links, etc. in an easy to parse XML format.

Step 4: Write a Script to Get Articles
Import Python’s feedparser module for parsing RSS feeds.
Write a function to take the RSS URL and extract key data like title, content, etc.
Store the parsed articles in a list or dictionary for further processing.
Handle errors and edge cases like empty feeds.

Step 5: Integrate TTS
Install the requests module to call web APIs.
Write a function to take article text, call the ElevenLabs API, and return the synthesized audio.
Pass options like voice, speech rate, etc. to customize the generated speech.
